A main goal of software development organizations is to improve software delivery and operations performance.

A lot of best practices and also different opinions about how to do "devops the right" way exist.
We have learnt that IT organizations and software delivery is a complex topic - and most of the time there are no "easy" answers: Instead context specific continuous improvement is a crucial element.

To bring more objectivity and a form of verifiability into this, we like using the four key metrics proposed by "The state of devops" and "DORA". These four key metrics are:

**Velocity:**

* Deployment Frequency (How frequently a team successfully releases to production, e.g., daily, weekly, monthly, yearly.)

* Lead Time for Changes (The median amount of time for a commit to be deployed into production.)

**Stability:**

* Time to Restore Services (For a failure, the median amount of time between the deployment which caused the failure and the remediation.)
* Change Failure Rate (The number of failures per the number of deployments.)

## About DORA

The DevOps Research and Assessment (DORA) is the largest and longest running research program of its kind, that seeks to understand the capabilities that drive software delivery and operations performance. With their report "The state of DevOps" they provide regular insides, observations and relations of "high performing" IT organizations.
